# Running benchmarks

These benchmarks are not conventional ones, these are for flamegraphs through the use of the `clinic` tool.
<br />
You can install clinic locally, as it is an optional dependency.
<br />
I get that running the benchmark using a python file might not be the best,but it generates the flamegraphs just fine so it doesn't matter.
