# Modules

Modules are reusable pieces of code that are frequently used throughout the codebase. Modules are not imperative to the core functioning of the codebase nor do they engage directly with the host or developer. The criteria can is quite lenient for what is a module, but the main goal is to encourage a non-monolithic structure to the application.
